Dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement
# Dataset Information
This data set consists of Placement data of students in our campus. It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and Work experience and salary offers to the placed students.

The dataset contains the following data:

sl_no = Serial Number

gender = Gender: Male='M', Female='F'

ssc_p = Secondary Education percentage - 10th Grade

ssc_b = Board of Education- Central/ Others

hsc_p = Higher Secondary Education percentage - 12th Grade

hsc_b = Board of Education - Central/ Others

hsc_s = Specialization in Higher Secondary Education

degree_p = Degree Percentage

degree_t = Under Graduation(Degree type) - Field of degree education

workex = Work Experience

etest_p = Employability test percentage ( conducted by college)

specialisation = Post Graduation(MBA)- Specialization

mba_p = MBA percentage

status = Status of placement- Placed/Not placed

salary = Salary offered by corporate to candidates

# Problem Statement
XYZ University wants to build machine learning model to know whethere student will get placed or not. So that they can provide special attention and help them to get job. Given dataset can be trated as classification or regression problem. In this project, I am going to focus on classification problem, where task is to find whethere candidate will placed or not. This is binary classification problem.
